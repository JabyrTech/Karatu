            <h2>Understanding Change</h2>
            <p>
                Changes are when things in your life become different. It could be moving to a new place, parents separating, or losing someone you love.

            <h2>Coping Strategies</h2>
            <p>
                When big changes happen, it's important to have ways to handle them. This could mean talking to someone you trust about how you feel, or finding activities like drawing or playing sports that help you feel better.

            <h2>Emotional Support</h2>
            <p>
                Feeling sad, scared, or confused during changes is normal. It's okay to talk about these feelings with friends, family, or a teacher. They can help you understand and feel better.

            <h2>Practical Adjustment</h2>
            <p>
                Sometimes, changes bring new routines or tasks. For example, if you move to a new house, you might need to learn a new bus route or make new friends. Taking small steps and asking for help can make these adjustments easier.

            <h2>Maintaining Stability</h2>
            <p>
                Even when things change, it helps to have things that stay the same. This could be keeping a bedtime routine or spending time with loved ones. Routines can help you feel safe and comfortable during changes.
