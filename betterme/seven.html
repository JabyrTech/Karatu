            <h2>Managing Emotions</h2>
            <p>
               <h4> Understanding and Expressing Emotions </h4>
Emotions are like signals that tell us how we feel. Happy, sad, angry, and scared are all types of emotions. It's important to recognize and talk about how you feel. Whether you’re excited about a new toy or upset because you had a bad day, sharing your feelings helps you feel better. <br>
<h4> Techniques for Emotional Regulation </h4>
Sometimes our feelings can get really strong. To calm down, try taking deep breaths, writing in a journal, or drawing a picture. These activities can help you feel more in control. <br>
<h4> Dealing with Anger and Frustration </h4>
Everyone gets angry sometimes. When you feel mad, try to find out what made you feel that way. Take a walk, count to ten, or talk to someone you trust. These actions can help you manage your anger without hurting others or yourself.

            <p>
             <h4>   Developing Coping Strategies </h4>
Life can be tough, but you’re tougher! Think about what you’re good at and use those strengths to tackle problems. Remember, it’s okay to ask for help from friends, family, or teachers when you need it. <br>

When things don’t go as planned, don’t give up! Learn from what went wrong and try again. Stay positive and keep pushing forward, even if it feels hard. <br>
<h4> The Power of Positive Thinking </h4>
Thinking positively can make a big difference. Start each day by thinking about something you’re thankful for. Use positive words when you talk to yourself, like “I can do this!” or “I am strong and capable.”
