            <h2>Online Safety</h2>
            <p>
                Be smart online! Always keep your personal information like your full name, address, and phone number private. Don't share it with people you don't know in real life.

            <h2>Healthy Screen Time</h2>
            <p>
                It's important to balance your time on screens with other activities like playing outside, reading books, or doing hobbies. Take breaks from screens to give your eyes and brain a rest.

            <h2>Digital Footprint</h2>
            <p>
                Your digital footprint is like a trail of your online activities. Be mindful of what you post or share online because it can stay there for a long time. Think before you click!

            <h2>Cyber Bullying Awareness</h2>
            <p>
                Cyberbullying is when someone is mean or hurtful to you online. If someone bullies you online, don't respond. Tell a trusted adult like a parent or teacher, so they can help you.

            <h2>Social Media Use</h2>
            <p>
                Social media can be fun for connecting with friends, but it's important to be careful. Don't share too much personal information online, and remember that not everything you see on social media is true.

            <h2>Online Relationships</h2>
            <p>
                When making friends online, make sure they are people you know in real life or that your parents know. Never meet someone in person that you only know from the internet without your parent's permission.

            <h2>Gaming and Virtual World</h2>
            <p>
                Playing games online is fun, but make sure it doesn't take up all your time. Balance gaming with other activities like homework, sports, or spending time with family and friends.
