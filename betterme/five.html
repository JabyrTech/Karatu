            <h2>Understanding Depression</h2>
            <p> <h4> Definition and Types of Depression </h4>
                Depression is a mental health condition that makes you feel very sad or empty for a long time. There are different types, like major depressive disorder, which makes you feel extremely sad and lose interest in activities you used to enjoy, and dysthymia, which is a long-term but less severe sadness. Bipolar disorder involves extreme mood swings between high energy and deep sadness. <br>
               <h4> Causes and Risk Factors </h4> Depression can be caused by many things. It might run in your family, or it could be due to stressful events like losing a loved one or having trouble at school. Sometimes, it’s a mix of different things happening at the same time.
